### an expressive vocal MIDI controller
A vocal MIDI controller plugin for Reaper.

This software was completed as a part of my undergraduate thesis. Here is the abstract, and [you can read the paper in full here] (https://uarkive.uark.edu/xmlui/bitstream/handle/10826/187/bhurlbur2011.pdf?sequence=1).

> The choice of controller often characterizes the performance obtained from an
> electronic instrument. Controllers exist that allow electronic musicians to mimic the
> expressive qualities of keyboard, wind, string, and percussion instruments, but vocalists
> have been largely neglected. To fill this need, a realtime software vocal MIDI controller
> named Grove is developed and demonstrated. Groveâ€™s pitch and time analyses are shown
> to be accurate, and it has mappable control signals that go beyond the capabilities of
> previous audio-to-MIDI converters to facilitate an expressive performance.
